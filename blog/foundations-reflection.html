      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have learned that my ego can be bruised when I feel like I should be
      able to do something that seems "simple" to me. I have learned more about
      what makes me frustrated, and
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p></p>
    <br />
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p></p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p></p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Human skills are just as important as your coding abilities if you are
      going to work as part of a team, which will be almost everyone. Coding is
      also very challenging, which puts extra stress on people and teams. This
      makes using human skills to navigate and mediate stressful human
      interactions crucial to success in the IT world.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the first two or three weeks it felt a bit pointless, mostly because I
      was eager to be learning anything I could about coding instead. But I have
      come to realise that being a developer is about learning and solving
      problems for people. To be able to do those two things effectively, you
      have to have great human skills.
