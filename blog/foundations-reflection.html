    <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have learned that my ego can get bruised when I can't do something
      "simple" that I think I should be able to do. I was definitely working
      with a fixed mindset, and began to get myself down when I thought that I
      didn't have a natural talent for coding. I am now working with a much more
      growth orientated mindset.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have learned more about what makes me frustrated, how to recognise when
      I am frustrated, and how to chill myself out when I am. Being able to
      recognise and acknowledge my emotions, then know what to do to help myself
      through frustrating times is going to be a crucial skill.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Values are always important, regardless of the context, as they frame how
      you operate in the world and how you treat yourself and others. Values are
      important in programming because they will inform the problems that you
      are willing to work on, who you will work for, and how you will work for
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Empathy is important in learning and programming. You need to have empathy
      for yourself while learning new skills, so that you don't burn-out on
      frustration and disappointment. You need to have empathy for others as
      they go through the same learning process, and while working with them on
      a project. Understanding other people's perspectives and emotions will
      enable you to work effectively as a team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-awareness is vital to recognising your own emotions, which allows you
      to mitigate the negative impacts of frustration and stress. It is also
      important to be aware of how you are treating yourself and others. You
      need to be able to recognise how your behaviours, negative or positive,
      are impacting your learning and how they are impacting others in your
      team.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
    <p>
      How impactful the growth mindset is! I had learned about it in the past,
      but apparently had not taken the lesson on-board properly. The subtle
      shift in my thinking, from "why can't I do this?" to "not a reason to
      quit, a problem to solve" has already helped immensely.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Self-introspection is not always easy. Recognising your emotions, being
      deeply honest with yourself about your faults, and learning how to address
      them is challenging stuff. But it's all been well worth it!
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Human skills are just as important as your coding abilities if you are
      going to work as part of a team, which will be almost everyone. Coding is
      also very challenging, which puts extra stress on people and teams. This
      makes using human skills to navigate and mediate stressful human
      interactions crucial to success in the IT world. Recruiters will be
      looking for coders with those skills.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
      instead? Justify your answer.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the first two or three weeks it felt a bit pointless, mostly because I
      was eager to be learning anything I could about coding instead. But I have
      come to realise that being a developer is about learning and solving
      problems for people. To be able to do those two things effectively, you
      have to have great human skills.
