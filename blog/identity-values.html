    <h1>21st June 2025</h1>
    <h2>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h2>
    <h3>
      Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
      you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
    </h3>
    <p>I am still pondering this one.</p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p>
      New Zealand has a fairly individualistic culture, and while I was growing
      up I definitely learned to rely solely on myself to solve problems and get
      things done. This has made me capable in a lot of areas but also stunted
      my ability to ask for help when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I value honesty and truth but I haven't always been honest with myself and
      others about when I was overwhelmed and needed help on a project. One of
      my old managers understood this about me and tried to coach me towards
      better communication practices. I am reminded of him whenever I recognise
      myself falling back into bad communication habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      My hope is that ultimately I can overcome that failing and become a good
      communicator of not just the technical side of things, but also the human
      side of things too.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey
    </h3>
    <p>
      I believe that I am a good listener. When someone is talking, I hear them
      the whole way through, try to understand their point of view, and ask
      clarifying questions if I don't understand them at first. This helps when
      working in teams as I always approach teamwork in a fair and democratic
      way, which people seem to appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am open minded to new ideas and different ways of doing things, and I
      have a genuine thirst for knowledge. This means that I always have a good
      time learning something new, as long as I have an interest in the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can read and write fairly well, so I can generally figure out what is
      being asked of me without trouble. In team activities I am often the
      scribe for the group. There are many people who don't like the
      documentation side of projects, so in the past I have fulfilled this role.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the past I have sometimes struggled to effectively communicate when I
      am struggling with a project and need help. I need to actively acknowledge
      to myself when I feel that way, and seek help when I need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I feel that a task is boring, repetitive, and not new in any way, I
      often seek out distractions to entertain myself. This can take up too much
      valuable time, so I need to be aware of when I am getting bored,
      acknowledge it, and maybe take a timed break so that I can be productive
      again.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the
      time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other
      strategies you would try now and why.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At an old job there was someone who constantly spoke in a very negative
      tone about their work, clients, and life in general. It was negatively
      affecting the rest of their team, to the point where it became very
      difficult to focus while working near them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person was my manager, so I found it difficult to address the issue
      directly with them. I broached the topic with their manager, who said it
      would be best if I addressed the problem directly with my manager. It was
      daunting but I asked my manager to sit with me one-on-one and they agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I explained to them the effect that their behaviour was having on the
      people around them, they apologised and let me know that they had been
      going through rough times, which I sympathised with. We were able to work
      through it, and although their behaviour was never perfect, it did improve
      a lot, which made it much easier to work with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      This helped me learn the power of facing issues head-on, but also being
      understanding, patient, and graceful with the people you work with, even
      when they're making things harder for everyone else. We're all human after
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had to do it again, I think I would do it the same way, but perhaps a
      lot earlier on. I really doubted my ability to resolve the situation at
      the time but I don't anymore.
