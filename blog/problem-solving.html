    <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
    <h3>A Time When I Was Blocked</h3>
    <p>
      I was really stuck on a challenge called "Super FlipFlop" where you need
      to write a function returns "flip", "flop", or "flipflop" based on the
      number passed to it. At first I tried Googling for similar examples, but
      all the examples that I found were not similar enough. I felt frustrated
      and a bit like a failure. I had to steer myself away from black and white
      thinking such as "I'm just not cut out for coding".
    </p>
    <p>
      I ended up reaching out to a facilitator for help, who gave me a video
      which went through the process of completing the challenge. By the end of
      the video, I still felt slightly confused, but not nearly as confused as I
      was during the challenge. I learned that for me, the best way of learning
      something is to see it be done in front of me, then for me to have a go at
      a similar example. I also need to remind myself to reach out for help
      sooner.
    </p>

    <h3>A Time When I Solved a Problem</h3>
    <p>
      I was stuck on a challenge where I needed to write a function that found
      Scooby Doo, in amongst an array of objects. I was struggling to find the
      best way to start my function, even though I knew the steps I needed to
      perform. Googling wasn't really working, as none of the examples I found
      really helped me. Again, I had to take small breaks when I felt myself
      getting frustrated, and I had to repeat my mantra ("a problem to solve,
      not a reason to quit") to keep myself going.
    </p>
    <p>
      After realising in previous challenges that I really needed to see the
      code being written once or twice to see how it worked, I found a YouTube
      video where someone wrote out a similar function. I was then able to solve
      my own problem using their logic. I learned that in many functions, I need
      to have a way to store my result, so that it can be used properly. YouTube
      is probably going to be an important problem-solving resource for me
      moving forward.
    </p>

    <h3>A Time When I Was Hesitant to Ask for Help</h3>
    <p>
      I hesitated a lot to ask for help during sprint 4. It is my natural
      inclination to believe that I can solve a problem on my own, and that
      asking for help can "look bad". I understand that logically, this
      perspective is completely unhelpful and is damaging to my future success,
      so I am attempting to re-train that inclination over time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>My Confidence with Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
    <p>
      I am least confident in the techniques of pseudocode, rubber ducky, and
      console.log. I need a lot more practice with pseudocode and console.log in
      particular, because I haven't used them much.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am more confident in the techniques of Googling and trying things until
      something works, although in retrospect, these techniques have been way
      less helpful to me overall. I am in the process of training myself to ask
      for help more readily when I need it.
