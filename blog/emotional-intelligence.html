    <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
    <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
    <p>
      Emotional intelligence is your capacity for recognising and understanding
      your own emotions, and the emotions of others. It also encompasses the
      skills to use that recognition and understanding to connect with yourself
      and others more effectively.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>How does EQ differ to IQ?</h3>
    <p>
      IQ refers to your capacity for learning and understanding new concepts. EQ
      refers specifically to the recognition and understanding of emotions.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
    <p>
      EQ is important for two main reasons. The first is that it helps you
      understand and work with yourself better. It's easy to be ruled by your
      emotions and not understand that it's happening. If you can recognise when
      you are experiencing negative emotions, you can work on ways to mitigate
      the negative impacts of that. If you're experiencing positive emotions,
      you can work on ways to flourish in that zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second reason is that we all need to work cooperatively with others.
      If you can't recognise and understand the emotions of others, getting
      along with them and working collaboratively with them will be virtually
      impossible.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Commitment to Practising Mindfulness</h3>
    <p>
      I commit to practising mindfulness through "walking zen". I used to
      meditate while walking a couple of years ago and I would like to commit to
      practising that again. I will meditate while walking the dog in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also commit to practising ~2min of mindfulness before each technical
      exercise in the Dev Academy Foundations course.
