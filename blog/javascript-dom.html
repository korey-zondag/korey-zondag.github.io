    <h2>JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
    <h3>What is JavaScript? What is it's relationship to HTML and CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      Using a house as an analogy, HTML is the foundation, including the walls,
      pillars, roofing, and the floor. CSS is the paint, the furniture, and the
      overall style of the house. JavaScript is the electricity, the lighting,
      the taps, the heating, and the other interactable things that make a house
      "come to life" and make it livable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, HTML and CSS build the content and style of a website, while
      JavaScript interacts with the HTML and CSS to make a website useful,
      allowing people to perform actions on the site.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>What is the Control Flow? What are loops?</h3>
    <p>
      Control Flow is the order of execution of statements in code. JavaScript
      executes statements in order from the top of the code to the bottom, but
      by using different statement types such as loops and conditionals, a
      programmer can manipulate the Control Flow and sequence events
      differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loops are a type of statement in JavaScript that can execute a block of
      code numerous times, each with a different value. There are different
      kinds of loops that can run through blocks of code in different ways to
      achieve a variety of outcomes. Some examples of different loop types
      include 'for', 'for/of', and 'while'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The below example shows a simple loop. The 'i' stands for iterator, as in
      one iteration of the loop. "i = 0" is where the loop will begin (0 in this
      case is the first loop). "i < 5" indicates how many loops will take place,
      in this case, it will loop as long as the iteration number is less than 5
      (so it will run 5 times). "i++" is...

    <p>
      Using an analogy from everyday life, making a coffee at a coffee machine,
      there's a default sequence of events that are followed (the Control Flow).
      First you need to grind the coffee beans, percolate the coffee grinds,
      empty the portafilter and rinse it, and then froth the milk. At this
      point, a loop is introduced that alters the Control Flow. You can choose
      not to have milk, at which point the sequence ends, or you can froth cow's
      milk, or oat milk, or almond milk, or soy milk. Another loop is introduced
      with the option to add extras, such as going to the cupboard to add
      cinnamon, going to the cupboard to add chocolate, or marshmallows, or
      nutmeg, or sugar.

    <h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
    <p>
      DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a tree-shaped representation
      of a web page that is created when the web page is loaded by the browser.
      It links HTML and JavaScript, allowing JavaScript to identify and alter
      the HTML elements in various ways. Each HTML element is represented within
      the DOM as a node.
