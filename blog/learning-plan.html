    <h1>21st June 2025 (Foundations Plan) & 15th July 2025 (Bootcamp Plan)</h1>
    <h2>My Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to practice my problem solving skills at an IT
      company until I have enough experience and knowledge to solve a problem
      that I am passionate about. I am not yet sure what that problem will be
      for me, but helping others solve their problems in the meantime seems like
      a good use of my time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Anticipated Strengths and Limitations in Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      Being kind to myself when I'm stressed out and frustrated is something I
      am still working on. I still feel quite negative when I can't solve a
      problem on my own, so I will need to remind myself of my mantra ("not a
      reason to quit, a problem to solve"), be mindful of my emotions, and
      regulate appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths are unchanged from the ones I expressed in my Foundations
      Learning Plan.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Anticipated Non-technical Challenges at Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      I fell behind during Sprint 4 of Foundations, so I will need to ensure I
      keep up with the Bootcamp material, which I anticipate will be way more
      more dense than Foundations. I will need to manage my time well, plan out
      my days, and stay focused on the task on the hand.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Human Skills That I Would Like to Develop</h3>
    <p>
      I would still like to develop my skills in communication, time-management,
      and leadership. Having completed Foundations, I know time-management will
      be crucial to my success. I hope to develop my skills in communication and
      leadership while working on projects in pairs or with my team.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Expectations From the Bootcamp Team</h3>
    <p>
      My expectations of the Bootcamp Team are unchanged from my Foundations
      Learning Plan.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Expectations of Myself During Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      I expect myself to seek help from my pair/team/home-group (directly) and
      the facilitators (via Discord) when I cannot solve a problem on my own in
      a timely manner. I expect to be kind to myself when I am stressed out
      and/or frustrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still expect to follow normal business hours during bootcamp
      (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm), and work over-time if needed to complete a
      project on-time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h2>My Foundations Learning Plan</h2>
    <h3>Long Term Goal</h3>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to become a developer, whether that is working
      full-time for a company or freelance as a contractor. I would like to
      begin by becoming a full-stack web developer. The skills I gained as a
      business analyst and junior product owner will combine well with skills
      gained as a developer to ensure a career in IT.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Learning Strengths and Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      My learning strengths include reading comprehension, curiosity and
      openness to new ideas, and a thirst for applicable knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my limitations with regards to learning include being easily
      distracted, going down non-relevant rabbit holes of information, and not
      always communicating my need for help when I really need it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Human Skills to Develop</h3>
    <p>
      There are three main human skills I would like to develop further while at
      Dev Academy. They are communication, time-management, and leadership. I
      sometimes have had the tendency to go off by myself and try to do a whole
      project alone, and not effectively communicate my timelines and when I
      needed help. I would like to develop my communication skills so that my
      team is aware of what I'm working on, and when they can expect work to be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also like to further develop leadership skills in planning and
      project delivery, which are skills I began to develop while working in
      product development.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Commitment to Managing Workload</h3>
    <p>
      During bootcamp I plan to split the 40 hours a week recommended time into
      normal business day hours (9am-5pm, Monday-Friday). If I need to work past
      5pm, or during the weekend to get something done individually or as part
      of a team, I am more than willing to do that, either in-person or online.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan on attending campus regularly, with the exact times to be discussed
      with my homegroup. I am flexible and amenable to working both in-person
      and online at different times.
    </p>
    <p>
      If something comes up and I need to take time away from a project, I will
      communicate that to anyone I am working with in a timely way, and work
      with them to manage both of our workloads fairly.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Commitment to Seeking Help</h3>
    <p>
      I commit to always being open to discussions, democratic with teamwork and
      team decisions, respectful, and professional. If I commit to a deadline, I
      will always endeavour to meet that deadline. I commit to effectively
      managing my emotions when things are building up and starting to get to
      me. If I need a break, I will take a break, and I will communicate that.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I need help and cannot solve the problem on my own in a timely way, I
      will seek help from my home-group, either in-person or via Discord. If my
      home-group cannot help me, I will seek help from facilitators via Discord.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Expectations from Facilitators</h3>
    <p>
      I expect the Facilitation team to be professional, to answer queries and
      technical questions in a timely and thorough way, to provide insights into
      the professional IT world that would be foreign to new-comers, to be
      gracious and patient when dealing with students, and to be available
      during normal business hours.
