    <h2>
      What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed
      positioning?
    </h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The position property in CSS determines where an element is placed on a
        browser page. Let's explore the relative, absolute, and fixed positions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Relative</strong> positions the element in a way that is
          relative to where it normally is on a page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Absolute</strong> positions the element relative to it's
          closest ancestor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fixed</strong> positions the element relative to the viewport
          used to view the content.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now let's look at examples for each position value.</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h3>Relative</h3>
      <p>
        Using values like top, right, bottom, and left, you can move an element
        around the page, relative to it's normal starting position.<br />
        In the example below, I created a box called "relative-box". The box
        started in the top left of the page. By using the "left" value, I moved
        the box 200px <em>from</em> the left of it's normal starting position.
      </p>
      <img
        src="blog-images/relativebox.png"
        alt="Box in default position"
      /><img
        src="blog-images/relativeboxcode.png"
        alt="CSS code for relative position"
      />
      <br />
      <img
        src="blog-images/relativebox2.png"
        alt="Box moved 200px from the left"
      /><img
        src="blog-images/relativeboxcode2.png"
        alt="CSS code for relative position 200px from the left"
      />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h3>Absolute</h3>
      <p>
        The absolute value places an element in relation to it's nearest
        ancestor, or containing class. If the containing class is moved, then
        the element with the absolute position value will also move with it.<br />
        In the example below, I brought back the "relative-box" and created a
        new blue box within it called "absolute-box". When I moved the
        "relative-box", the "absolute-box" moved too.
      </p>
      <img
        src="blog-images/absolutebox.png"
        alt="Box showing another box inside it"
      /><img
        src="blog-images/absoluteboxcode.png"
        alt="CSS code for an absolute position box 
        inside another box"
      /><br />
      <img
        src="blog-images/absolutebox2.png"
        alt="Box moved 200px from the left"
      /><img
        src="blog-images/absoluteboxcode2.png"
        alt="CSS code for an absolute position box 
        inside a box moved 200px from the left"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <br />
      <h3>Fixed</h3>
      <p>
        The fixed value fixes the element in place according to the viewport or
        web browser. Again by using values like top, right, bottom, and left,
        you can fix an element in place, scroll up and down the page, and the
        fixed element will "stick" to the screen. <br />
        In the example below, I created a box called "fixed-box". I placed some
        text below it, and as I scrolled down, the box stayed fixed in the top
        left-hand corner of the screen. First it covered paragraphs 1-3, then it
        covered paragraphs 4-6.
      </p>
      <img
        src="blog-images/fixedbox.png"
        alt="Box in a fixed position on the page"
      /><img
        src="blog-images/fixedboxcode.png"
        alt="CSS code for box in a fixed position on the page"
      />
      <br />
      <img
        src="blog-images/fixedbox2.png"
        alt="Box in a fixed position on the page with 
      the page scrolled down"
      />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <p>Now let's look at two additional position values.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sticky</strong> positions the element based on the scroll
          position.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Static</strong> positions the element in the default position
          for that element.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let's look at some examples of sticky and strong positions.</p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h3>Sticky</h3>
      <p>
        On the surface, the sticky value is very similar to the fixed value. It
        "sticks" an element to the scroll bar, meaning that when you scroll on
        your web browser, the element will move along with your scroll. This
        differs from the fixed value because the fixed value "sticks" the
        element to your viewport or web browser screen.<br />
        In the example below, I created a box called "sticky-box". I placed some
        text below it and the box didn't cover the text until I scrolled down
        the page. In the "fixed-box" example, the box covered the text below it
        regardless of whether I scrolled down the page or not. That is the
        difference between the fixed and sticky values in action.
      </p>
      <img src="blog-images/stickybox.png" alt="Box above some text" /><img
        src="blog-images/stickyboxcode.png"
        alt="CSS code for a box with the sticky 
        position value"
      /><br />
      <img
        src="blog-images/stickybox2.png"
        alt="Box with the sticky position value in front 
      of some text"
      />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <h3>Static</h3>
      <p>
        The static value is the default position for elements. This value sets
        the element to it's default position and it cannot be moved. Unlike the
        rest of the values explored above, the static value is unaffected by the
        top, right, bottom, and left values.<br />
        In the example below, I created a box called "static-box". I set the
        left value to 200px and the top value to 200px, yet the box did not
        move.
      </p>
      <img
        src="blog-images/staticbox.png"
        alt="A box in a static position on the page"
      /><img
        src="blog-images/staticboxcode.png"
        alt="CSS code for a box with the static position value"
      />
    </div>
