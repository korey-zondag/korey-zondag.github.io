    <h2>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2>
    <h3>How does understanding neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
    <p>
      Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can help people alleviate
      mental illnesses, overcome damages to the brain, perform better in school,
      improve memory, and learn new skills later on in life when it is seemingly
      more difficult to do so.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      Movement and learning new skills through dextrous hobbies seem to be two
      of the best ways to improve neuroplasticity. Repetitive practice builds
      new neural pathways in the brain.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      How I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity to benefit my
      learning.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I will need to keep up with my daily walks with the dog and do a big hike
      once a week as my exercise. Although I do not currently have a dextrous
      hobby, I will look into either a sport (like badminton) or crafting hobby
      that will include learning a range of new skills.

    <h3>What is the 'growth mindset'? Why is it relevant?</h3>
    <p>
      We tend to have a bias towards believing that natural talent, ability, and
      inherited circumstances are what determine our success or failure. This
      bias is often reinforced through society and culture. Many people then
      defeat themselves before they have even had the chance to succeed.
      Understanding that the mind can grow, change, and adapt to overcome
      challenges in ways previously thought impossible can help us all succeed.

      I found useful on the topic of adaptability and the growth mindset was
      created by Dr. K. at HealthyGamerGG.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>How I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey.</h3>
    <p>
      When considering how to integrate the growth mindset into my studies, I
      thought about the importance of how I think about challenges, and the
      behaviour I exhibit when faced with challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need to readily pay attention to my own thoughts, most importantly when
      I am struggling or am frustrated with a challenge. My natural reaction is
      to try solve the problem but when I can't do that instantly, I get
      frustrated and give up. I need to practice acknowledging how I feel, and
      then work to reframe my natural inclination to reflexively give up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cognitive flexibility will be crucial to success in my studies. My mantra
      will be "not a reason to quit, but a problem to solve". Keeping this in
      mind, and doing it in practice, will help me overcome challenges that in
      the past would've defeated me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will also need to be aware of black and white thinking, such as "I will
      never be able to solve this problem", or "I will never make a good
      developer". Catching myself in the moment of frustration, taking a small
      break and getting some fresh air when I need to, practicing mindfulness,
      and reframing the problem to solve will help me keep going.
