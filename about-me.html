        Kia ora! I'm Korey, a Full Stack Web Developer who made the transition
        from Business Analysis. After working closely with software developers
        for over 5 years, I decided that what they were doing looked like great
        fun, and decided that building the future in code is what I wanted to
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a graduate of Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I was trained to solve
        technical problems solo, in a pair, and in groups, using a variety of
        tools including TypeScript/JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express,
        PostgreSQL, and more. I'm a big believer in maintaining a growth
        mindset, which has allowed me to learn a lot in a short amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background in customer service and service management means I focus
        on the end-user's experience, and I love to work collaboratively. My
        experience as a Business Analyst means I plan methodically, make
        decisions based on evidence, and I believe the details matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently building Chorely, a web application that will allow users
        to manage and track their chores with other users.
